CZ4010 Applied Cryptography

This project is developed in accordance to the course project of CZ4010 Applied Cryptography. 
**Title**: Implementation &amp; Analysis of Henon Map on Image Encryption

### Motivation
Many different algorithms such as AES and DES have been seen to be used for data encryption. However, as digital images have different characteristics as compared to conventional text data, more specialised algorithms are needed in order to encrypt them.
